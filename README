# RTDB (Realtime Database)

This is an implementation of a simple realtime database using key-value stores.

## Usage

1. Connect to the TCP server
2. Send messages to create, read, update, and delete key-value stores.
3. All values are stored as strings, for simplicity.

Use the client script provided in `/demo/client.js` to interface with the server from the command line.
